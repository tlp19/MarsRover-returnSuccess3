# Group 10 - MarsRover Project Repository

This is the general repository for all the code of the EEE/EIE Year 2 summer-term project.

For this project, we built a Robot (Mars Rover) and developed the software to control it remotely. This Robot is completely wireless and has its own Power management solution. The Robot also has an embedded camera allowing it to detect obstacles and trigger its obstacle avoidance algorithm.

You can find below a video demonstration of our Rover's capabilities:
